## The Role and Characteristics of a Project Manager

Project Managers are found in all industries and types of work. Their job includes the management of the Triple Constraint as we have previously discussed. Their job is also to lead a project team and be effective in managing relationships and communications with everyone involved and affected by the project. There is a management component to being a Project Manager as schedules, scope, risk, quality, and budgets must all be managed. In addition, Project Managers need leadership skills as they lead a project team, negotiate contracts, resolve issues and problems, and meet expectations of Stakeholders. The ability to successfully negotiate with others for resources, time, and money can be critical to project success. The ability to lead a team of talented, strong-willed people is another key to success. Leadership requires leadership skills and behavioral skills (aka "soft skills").

It is important for the Project Manager to understand and be able to apply Project Management techniques and tools, to have a good sense of the organization's business goals, and maintain an accurate budget, but that is not enough. An effective, competent Project Manager needs excellent political, interpersonal, communication, leadership, and mediation skills.

One of the most important jobs of the Project Manager is to manage the risks inherent in the project. This means seriously thinking about what can go wrong with the project and creating backup plans to deal with the unexpected events. Constantly asking, "What if...?" This means:

- Having a plan in place to handle team conflict.
- Having a plan in place to deal with a customer always wanting to make changes.
- Having a plan in place to mentor and coach poor performers on your team.
- Having a plan in place to deal with possible quality issues.
- Having a plan in place to develop a collaborative relationship with other managers.

As you can see, the role of the Project Manager goes far beyond their ability to manage a project schedule. The best project schedule in the world still won't help a Project Manager that has poor communication skills. With these skills in mind, let's take a look at the role of the Project Manager in contrast to other managers within an organization.

## Project Managers Compared to Functional Managers

When we think of managers, usually we think of the functional manager or the department manager- the person who manages an organizational unit such as marketing, accounting & payroll, research, human resources,manufacturing, facilities, and so on. These units provide products or services to all areas of the organization, and usually specialize in producing one type of result, product, or service. Functional groups are also typically responsible for company operations within their specialization area. The manager of these functional units is usually a specialist in the function that the department represents.

On the other hand, a Project Manager is more of an integrator, working with and drawing people from across functional units. The Project Manager by necessity must use a broad approach; he or she collects skills and talents across functional departments and assembles a team of people and talents that will be used to tackle the project. The Project Manager does not need to be a specialist, although the members of his/her team must be.

As an integrator, the Project Manager faces demands that the functional manager never sees, such as:

- Resource allocation conflicts
- Motivating "borrowed" personnel
- Constantly making trade-offs between goals and constraints
- Working with new, untried, and possibly undeveloped technology
- Negotiating with people in the organization, at every level, who may or may not want to collaborate.

This is why Project Managers must have many competencies - as a manager, as a leader, as an employee, as a business person.
