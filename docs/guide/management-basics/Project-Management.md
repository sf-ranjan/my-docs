title: Project Management
---

Project Management consists of the methods and tools used to deliver a project that meets its stated objectives. At first glance, this may seem straightforward. Objectives typically represent themselves in terms of cost, time, and scope (also known as the Triple Constraint). As long as we know the objectives, we should be able to meet them, right? It may come as a surprise to you, but often times projects fail to meet their objectives. It isn't so simple because the number of factors that must be controlled can, and often do, interact in unexpected ways. Consequently, the project becomes more complicated as the number of factors increases.

Projects are encountered in various aspects of life, such as remodeling a home, developing a new product at work, or pursuing an academic degree. Each scenario requires careful oversight of key factors:

Controlling expenses during a home renovation, monitoring feature additions to manage costs in product development, or allocating time effectively to complete academic requirements are examples of project management challenges.

Successful project management involves:

- Systematically managing costs, schedules, and scope.
- Anticipating and planning for potential issues.
- Addressing risks effectively.
- Ensuring clear communication among stakeholders.
- Providing effective leadership to the project team.

These activities collectively contribute to achieving project objectives.

### The Triple Constraint

Whether complex or simple, high-budget or low-budget, lengthy or brief in time, all projects have the same three general objectives:

- Meeting the scope, including quality criteria of the deliverables.
- Meeting time constraints.
- Meeting cost boundaries.

These three objectives are collectively referred to as the "Triple Constraint." We will refer to the Triple Constraint many times throughout this guide.
The Triple Constraint works together in an interesting fashion. They must always be kept in balance with each other, which is one of the biggest challenges that a Project Manager faces.

### Triple Constraint Example

Let's say you want to build a house. You want it to be a 3-bedroom house, to be built in 3 months and for no more than \$170,000.

First, you need to:

- Design the house with a blueprint or a plan.
- Determine the cost of materials and labor to build the house according to the design.
- Ensure you have the proper staff with the necessary skills to complete the house within 3 months.

If you find that building your dream house requires \$200,000 in materials and labor, you may need to:

- Pick cheaper materials.
- Reduce labor costs.
- Change your plan to be less elaborate, such as building a smaller house (reduced scope).

Similarly, if the house will take 4 months to build, you must:

- Adjust your budget to cover the extra month of resources.
- Consider reducing the scope to stay within your budget.

The Triple Constraint works much like a three-legged stool. All three legs must be in balance for the stool to stand upright and provide a flat surface. If one leg is shortened or lengthened, the stool tips. Similarly, if one constraint is adjusted, the other two must accommodate to maintain balance and achieve the project's objectives.

Effective Project Managers understand the impact of changes in one constraint on the other two. They continuously manage these trade-offs throughout the project to achieve the desired scope and quality.

### Managing the Triple Constraint

Which constraint of the Triple Constraint is the most important for a Project Manager to manage? In theory, they are equally important, but on any particular project, one may be more important than another. A Project Manager must understand their customer and needs to know which of the Triple Constraints may be more important (i.e. meeting the schedule, meeting the budget, or delivering the scope). This becomes important when the Project Manager needs to find solutions to issues or risks encountered and needs to trade off a constraint to meet the project objectives.

Let's look at some examples. The image below represents the Triple Constraint.

Let's explore how altering one of the constraints impacts the overall project.

If your cost is decreased, and you must deliver in the same amount of time, then the impact would be to decrease the scope:

If your schedule is decreased, and you must provide the same deliverables, the impact would be to increase the cost:

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="/img/Schedule_Decreased_Triple_Constraint3.png" alt="Alt Text" width="200" height="150"></img></p>

If your scope is increased, then the impact would be to either increase the cost or increase the time (or both):

The table below summarizes the impact of changes to one Triple Constraint element on the others:

| Constraint Changed | Impact on Other Constraints                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost Decreased     | Scope decreases to stay within budget.                        |
| Schedule Decreased | Cost increases to meet the tighter deadline.                  |
| Scope Increased    | Cost and/or time increases to accommodate the expanded scope. |

Effective Project Managers recognize these trade-offs and make informed decisions to balance the Triple Constraint while achieving project objectives.

:::tip[Summary]
Project Management is about much more than simply meeting objectivesâ€”it requires balancing scope, time, and cost while navigating the complexities and uncertainties of each unique project. The Triple Constraint illustrates how these three elements are interconnected: a change in one will almost always impact the others. Successful Project Managers continuously assess priorities, manage trade-offs, and communicate effectively to ensure project goals are achieved while maintaining this critical balance.
