:::info[**DEFINITION**]

According to the Project Management Institute: **"A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result."**

:::

Let’s break down this definition to better understand what a project is—and what it is not:

- **Temporary endeavor:** Projects have a defined start and end date. They do not continue indefinitely. Ongoing activities are typically called processes or operations.
- **Unique deliverable:** Every project aims to create something unique—a product, service, or result. While projects may be similar, no two are exactly the same. This uniqueness distinguishes projects from processes, which are repeatable and focus on consistency and standardization.
- **Deliverable:** The outcome of a project could be a new product, a building, a merger, or an improved service. The key is that there is a tangible result.

## Project Characteristics

Projects also have clearly defined:

### Objectives

Projects are driven by specific goals, which may be technical (e.g., developing new technology), legal or political (e.g., meeting regulations), or business-related (e.g., outperforming competitors). These objectives should be measurable.

### Scope

Scope includes all the work required to deliver the project’s result and meet its objectives at the expected level of quality. It defines what is included—and what is not.

### Cost

This is the planned budget for the project, covering both human and physical resources.

### Time-Schedule

Projects have a planned timeline for completion, including key milestones along the way.

### Examples of Projects

- Building a house
- Developing a mobile application
- Launching a new product
- Improving a service (e.g., customer service, Six Sigma initiative)

## Projects vs. Processes

Projects are temporary and unique, while processes (or operations) are ongoing and repeatable.

For example, in a renewable energy company, constructing a PV plant or wind farm is considered a project—it is temporary and delivers a unique outcome. Once the plant is operational, responsibility shifts to the operations team, whose job is to ensure smooth, consistent functioning according to established procedures. This ongoing work is a process.

## Projects and Processes in Disaster Management

Consider an agency coordinating disaster mitigation, response, and recovery across several countries. The agency may receive funding for specific projects, such as improving early warning systems or making schools safer. These projects have defined objectives, timelines, and scope, and may last from one to ten years.

At the same time, the agency runs internal processes, such as monitoring and reporting using specialized software. These processes help management track performance and identify areas for improvement. Unlike projects, these activities are continuous.

:::tip[**Summary**]
In summary, projects are temporary efforts with unique outcomes, while processes are ongoing activities focused on consistency and efficiency.
