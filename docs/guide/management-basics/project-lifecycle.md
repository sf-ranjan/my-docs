title: Project Life cycle
---

Every project, no matter its size or industry, progresses through a series of well-defined stages called the **Project Lifecycle**: **Initiation, Planning, Execution**, and **Closure**. Recognizing and following these phases helps teams manage projects systematically and achieve desired results.

The project lifecycle serves as a roadmap, dividing the work into clear, manageable phases. Each phase has its own goals, deliverables, and tasks. Although every project produces different outcomes, the lifecycle structure remains the same, offering a reliable framework for project management.

:::info[**Example:**]  
Imagine you are building a new mobile app. The project will start by defining what the app should do (Initiation), planning how to build it (Planning), actually developing and testing the app (Execution), and finally launching it and wrapping up the project (Closure).

## Project Lifecycle Phases

The four main phases of a typical project lifecycle.

### Predictive Project Life Cycle

(also known as a "Waterfall" or "plan-driven" life cycle) is a project management approach where the project’s scope, schedule, and cost are determined early in the project, and most planning is done upfront. In this model, the project progresses through a series of sequential phases—such as Initiation, Planning, Execution, and Closure—with each phase completed before the next begins.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><b>Typical Cost and Staffing Levels Across a Generic Project Life Cycle Structure</b></p>
This approach works best when requirements are well understood and unlikely to change, as it emphasizes careful planning, documentation, and control. Changes are managed through formal processes, and progress is measured against the original plan. Predictive life cycles are commonly used in construction, manufacturing, and other industries where deliverables and processes are clearly defined from the start.

### 1. Initiation Phase

**Objective:** Define the project’s purpose, objectives, and stakeholders, and determine if the project should proceed.

- Identify the business need, problem, or opportunity the project addresses.
- Analyze the feasibility and potential benefits of the project.
- Identify key stakeholders and clarify their roles and expectations.
- Assign a Project Manager to lead the effort.

:::tip[**Project Charter**]
A **Project Charter** is a formal document that authorizes the start of a project. It outlines the project’s objectives, scope, key stakeholders, high-level requirements, initial risks, constraints, assumptions, and the roles and responsibilities of the project team. The Project Charter provides a clear direction and serves as a reference throughout the project, ensuring everyone understands the project’s purpose and what success looks like. It is typically approved by project sponsors or senior management, giving the project manager the authority to allocate resources and begin project work.
:::

- Develop a **Project Charter** that outlines:
  - Project objectives and high-level requirements
  - Scope and boundaries
  - Key stakeholders and their responsibilities
  - Initial risks, constraints, and assumptions
  - Success criteria and alignment with organizational goals
  - Obtain formal approval or authorization to move forward.

:::info[**Example:**]  
For the mobile app, the Initiation Phase involves researching the market to confirm user demand, defining the app’s main features and goals, identifying stakeholders (such as users, sponsors, and developers), and assigning a project manager. The team then creates a Project Charter to document these details and secures approval to begin planning.
:::

### 2. Planning Phase

**Objective:** Develop a detailed roadmap for achieving the project’s objectives.

- Identify all tasks and resources required.
- Create a **Project Plan** with activities, dependencies, and timelines.
- Prepare a **budget** and identify risks.
- Develop supporting plans:
  - **Resource Plan:** Who will do the work?
  - **Communication Plan:** How will stakeholders be kept informed?
  - **Quality Plan:** How will quality be measured?
  - **Procurement Plan:** What needs to be purchased?
  - **Acceptance Plan:** What criteria must be met for success?

:::info[**Example:**]
The team creates wireframes, sets a timeline for development, estimates costs, identifies potential risks (like technology changes), and plans how to communicate progress to stakeholders.
:::

### 3. Execution Phase (Including Monitoring and Control)

**Objective:** Deliver the project according to the plan, while continuously monitoring progress, managing resources, and making adjustments as needed to ensure successful completion.

- Execute the tasks and activities defined in the project plan, coordinating team members and resources.
- Monitor progress against the schedule, budget, and quality standards using key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular status meetings.
- Track and manage project risks, issues, and changes through established processes (such as change requests and risk registers).
- Communicate status updates, milestones, and any deviations from the plan to stakeholders, ensuring transparency and alignment.
- Manage procurement and vendor relationships, ensuring that external deliverables are received on time and meet requirements.
- Ensure deliverables are produced according to quality and acceptance criteria, conducting reviews, inspections, and testing as needed.
- Adjust plans, schedules, and resource allocations in response to unforeseen challenges or opportunities, maintaining focus on project objectives.

:::info[**Example:**]
During the Execution Phase of the mobile app project, developers write code and integrate features, testers validate functionality, and designers refine the user interface. The project manager monitors progress using project management tools, holds regular stand-up meetings, and updates the project schedule as tasks are completed or delayed. If a critical bug is discovered, the team assesses its impact, updates the risk register, and communicates the issue and mitigation plan to stakeholders. Procurement activities, such as purchasing third-party APIs or design assets, are managed to ensure timely delivery. Throughout, the team ensures that each feature meets the defined quality standards before moving to the next stage.
:::

### 4. Closure Phase

**Objective:** Complete the project and transfer deliverables to the customer.

- Release final deliverables.
- Handover documentation.
- Release project resources.
- Close contracts with suppliers.
- Conduct a **post-project review** to capture lessons learned and best practices.

:::info[**Example:**]  
The app is launched, documentation is handed over to the support team, contracts with vendors are closed, and the team meets to discuss what went well and what could be improved for future projects.
:::

:::tip[**Summary**]

The Project Lifecycle provides a clear roadmap for managing projects from start to finish. By following the four key phases—Initiation, Planning, Execution, and Closure—project teams can ensure that objectives are met, risks are managed, and valuable lessons are captured for future improvement. Using guided examples, such as building a mobile app, helps illustrate how these phases apply in real-world scenarios, making the process easier to understand and implement.
