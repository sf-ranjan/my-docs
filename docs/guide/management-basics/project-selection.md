Projects can be initiated from many sources within an organization. Typically, an organization has more projects than they have resources to deliver them. So, they have a choice: to either try to get all the projects done with minimal resources and lengthen the time to achieve the benefits for every project, or they can narrow down the list of projects to those that will reap the greatest benefit to the clients, the business, and the employees. If the project list is narrowed, it allows an organization to properly staff for effective delivery. Project selection is the process used by companies to decide the best projects to implement. We will also be discussing the various types of organizations a project manager may operate within and the advantages and disadvantages that each structure brings.

## Project Selection Overview

In the workplace of today, managers increasingly use a project-approach to achieve business goals. Managers think strategically and employ the use of projects, teams, collaboration, empowered employees, and experimentation. Strategic management focuses on the major goals and objectives that will make a company successful. Sample strategies for an organization might include establishing a sales office in India within 2 years, releasing an innovative game console in the US prior to the holiday shopping season, or increasing gross margins by 10% in the next fiscal year.
Strategic management is not "tactical." It does not focus on the day-to-day activities that are necessary to keep a company running. Rather, strategic management thinks at a high level and looks to the future and the big picture.
The project-approach plays an important role in strategic management by providing a measured, structured way to reduce the uncertainty in strategic business activities. The business activities might include events like establishing a new marketing department, developing a new cosmetic product, launching an overseas sales office, building a manufacturing facility, constructing a new Research & Development building, revamping a sales campaign, and so on.

However, not all projects have the same benefits to an organization and their clients and that is where a project selection process becomes valuable.
**Project selection is the process of evaluating projects and choosing to implement those that are best aligned to the strategic goals of the organization and offer the most benefits to the organization, their clients, and their employees. When choosing which projects to implement, we would hope that an organization uses rational, logical decision criteria.**
Why go through all of this? Undoubtedly, there are many projects a company would want to launch, but as most companies have limited resources, they have two choices:

1. Spread available resources across a large number of projects, resulting in a small number of resources working on each project and little to no progress made on each.
2. Be selective about the projects they undertake so that each can be fully staffed and achieve their objectives in the desired time frame.

This means that there has to be a mechanism for evaluating the many projects that a company would like to launch, but can't afford to. We will start by defining the most common financial measures used to evaluate projects.

### Financial Measures for Selecting Projects

The most common financial measures used to evaluate projects are: **Payback Period, Net Present Value, and Profitability Index**. Each of these measures provide a view into the financial viability of a project based on different monetary approaches. The estimates used for these calculations are typically established and provided by the organization. For example, the finance department or a company's executives would know the cost of capital investments and can provide a project manager with the required rate of return that a project must be able to achieve in order for it to be considered profitable.

Organizations use these financial measures to prioritize projects as most organizations have limited resources with which to work. Those projects with better financial indicators would typically be prioritized higher than those with less attractive financials. This prioritization helps an organization to narrow down the list of projects they will initiate and those that may have to seek better options for viability.

### Accuracy in financial measure

It is important to note that the financial measures we have discussed (Payback Period, Net Present Value, and Profitability Index). For example, if the cash flow estimates are not accurate, such as the initial investment is underestimated or the cash inflows are overestimated, this can have a serious impact on the accuracy of the financial measures such as Payback Period, Profitability, and NPV because if you look at the calculation, The Payback Period calculates how long it will take to return the initial investment of the project.

#### Payback Period

:::info[the formula for Payback Period is the initial investment divided by the periodic cash flow:]

$$
P = \frac{I}{C}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
P &: \text{ Payback Period} \\
I &: \text{ Initial Investment} \\
C &: \text{ Periodic Cash Flow}
\end{align*}
$$

:::
**Dividing by annual cash flow gives you the payback time in years.** The shorter the Payback Period, the quicker an organization can achieve financial benefits.

For example, if you invest \$10,000 in a new product and take in \$1000 a year in cash related to the product, it will take you ten years to get back your initial investment. Ten years times 1000 equals 10,000. The drawback of using Payback Period as a reliable means for determining the financial benefit of a project is that it does not take into account the time value of money. Because we know that over time the value of money deflates, any project that stretches across multiple years should consider using financial calculations that consider the time value of money.

Net Present Value and Profitability Index both consider that the value of money decreases over time. The value of ten dollars received in five years is less than if you receive ten dollars today.

#### Net Present Value

Net Present Value, or NPV, determines the difference of the initial investment and the value of the cash inflows over time, considering a rate of return and the time value of money.
:::info[**The formula for Net Present Value aka NPV is shown here:**]

$$
NPV = -C_o + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
C_o &: \text{ Initial Cash Flow} \\
C_i &: \text{ Cash Flow for Time Period } i \\
T   &: \text{ Total Time period} \\
r   &: \text{ Rate of return}
\end{align*}
$$

:::

Where the initial cash investment represented as a negative plus the sum from time period i to T of the cash inflows divided by the quantity 1 plus the required rate of return raised to the ith power. Let's look at an example.

Our project has an initial investment of \$100,000. The annual cash inflow is \$35,000 a year for five years. The required rate of return is 15%.
:::tip[**The Net Present Value, or NPV, formula would be as follows:**]

$$
-100000+\frac{35000}{(1+.15)^1}+\frac{35000}{(1+.15)^2}+\frac{35000}{(1+.15)^3}+\frac{35000}{(1+.15)^4}+\frac{35000}{(1+.15)^5}
$$

For the next step, we will round to the nearest whole number. This gives us

$$
-100000+30435+26465+23013+20011+17401\\
=17325
$$

:::
:::danger[TIP]
**An NPV value of zero indicates that the project will return enough money to meet the organization's required rate of return. Any value above zero will indicate that the organization can achieve an even higher rate of return than what is required.**
:::

An NPV that is negative indicates that the organization will never get a return on the money invested and should consider not pursuing that project. In our example, the NPV is above zero, so there will be a higher rate of return than what was required.

#### Profitability Index

Profitability Index is similar to NPV in that it also considers the time value of money in its calculation.
Profitability Index is expressed in the form of a ratio. That is, the ratio of the present value of cash inflows to the initial investment.

:::info[Profitability Index]

$$
\text{Profitability Index} = \frac{\text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows}}{\text{Initial Investment Required}}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Profitability Index} &: \text{ Ratio indicating project viability} \\
\text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows} &: \text{ Sum of discounted future inflows} \\
\text{Initial Investment Required} &: \text{ Upfront cost to start the project}
\end{align*}
$$

:::

#### Present value of future cash flows

The formula for the present value of future cash flows divided by the initial investment required. The present value of future cash flows is the same as part of the formula used for the net present value.
:::info[present value of future cash flows]

$$
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}
$$

:::
For a finalized Profitability Index, if we round to one decimal place. A ratio of greater than one is a sign that the project will return financial benefits to the organization. If the ratio is less than one, this means the NPV is also less than zero, which means the organization should consider not pursuing that project.

As such The estimates used to conduct the financial viability must be done with great care so as to make them as accurate as possible. Wherever possible, experts' opinions, past project histories, and even computer simulations should be used to verify the estimates are as accurate as possible.

### Non-Financial Criteria for Selecting Projects

Although organizations will use financials to determine the viability of selecting a project, financial measures are not the only criteria that an organization should consider when investing money in a project. There are non-financial criteria that should be considered. Sometimes, non-financial criteria may drive an organization to select a project with less than desirable financial measures. Some examples are:

- To meet new government or legal regulations. For example, a new law that requires the business to implement a new process or modify/upgrade their existing equipment to not be in violation of the law.
- To gain competitive advantage. For example, to launch a new product ahead of a competitor, or to invest in research and development projects to maintain or increase market share.
- To invest in new technologies or processes. For example, to implement the latest technology in the organization to improve the efficiency and productivity of their workers, or to improve an existing process in the organization that would create cost savings in future years.

### Project Selection Process

Typically, organizations use a combination of both financial and non-financial criteria to determine the best projects to select. A typical project selection process would likely include the following steps:

1. Business plan identifies project opportunities aligned to the organization's strategy OR an employee has an idea for a project and reviews it with their management team for concurrence to proceed and get allocated funding.

2. Management submits project information on a standardized form. This form typically includes basic level business criteria such as the project goals and deliverables, project purpose, the business reason or business problem addressed by the project, and general information about the project cash outflow, inflow, and market potential.

3. Project Portfolio team reviews the project suggestions and pre-selects projects based on a set of criteria that best matches the strategic plans of the organization.

4. Projects undergo additional feasibility studies to confirm viability and confirm the financial and non-financial benefits. This typically includes a review of the project resource requirements.

5. A final set of projects is prioritized and selected with Project Managers assigned to begin Project Initiation. Once the finalized projects are selected, they are incorporated into the organization's Project Portfolio which typically undergoes regular reviews by management to ensure that the portfolio as a whole contains the projects necessary for the overall success of the organization.
   :::note
   _Organizations that utilize a process such as the one described above typically will not allow rogue projects to be initiated within departments or functional units as this will dilute the resource pool as well as possibly invest money in projects with less than desirable returns. Although these types of rogue projects can and do exist, the more disciplined the organization is in utilizing a project selection and Project Portfolio management process, the less likely these types of projects will exist._
