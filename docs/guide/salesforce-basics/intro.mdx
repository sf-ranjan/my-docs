- **Salesforce** is a _Platform as a Service (PaaS)_ and _Software as a Service (SaaS)_ provider.
- **Salesforce is not** an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider.
- **Force.com** is a PaaS offered by Salesforce for building platform applications.
- Salesforce uses a **multitenant architecture**: multiple tenants share a single instance of the application, environment, hardware, or storage.
- Salesforce generates **18-digit case-insensitive External IDs** and **15-digit case-sensitive Record IDs**.
- Convert 15-digit case-sensitive record IDs to 18-digit case-insensitive IDs using the `CASESAFEID()` formula function.

:::tip
Use `CASESAFEID()` to safely reference record IDs in integrations and formulas.

## User Licenses

- Every user must be assigned a **user license** to access Salesforce. A user's license determines the baseline of features that the user can access.

### Types of User Licenses

#### Login-Based User Licenses

- _Lightning Platform Starter_ and Lightning Platform Plus licenses contain a Salesforce Platform User license. The Salesforce Platform License and Salesforce Platform Login licenses can use the Salesforce Platform permission set.
- _Lightning Platform Plus_
- _Salesforce Platform Login_

#### Based on Job Function

- Lightning Platform user license Standard object permissions for accounts and contacts (not cases).
- Salesforce user license Full access to standard CRM apps and objects (accounts, contacts, cases).
- Salesforce packages licenses in SKUs (stock-keeping units). SKUs may contain one or more licenses and capabilities. Generally, the name of the SKU and the license match, but not always.

## Queue in Salesforce

- A queue is a group of users who collaborate effectively to share the workload.
- Any record assigned to a queue requires the user in that queue to accept it as their own to become the record’s owner.
- Once a user becomes the owner, they can transfer ownership of the record to another queue user or any other user.
- Whenever you are transferring a record to another user. that new user should have Salesforce Licenses assigned to him.

:::tip
When transferring a record, ensure the new user has a Salesforce license assigned.
:::

## Permission Set

- Within an organizational structure, <mark>we can create up to 1000 permission sets.</mark>
- These sets are utilized to enhance access levels.
- To assign a permission set, the user must possess a Salesforce license.

### Permission Set Group

- With permission set groups, you can bundle permission sets together based on a job function.
- A permission set group includes all permissions in the permission sets.
- If you’re a subscriber to an app with permission set groups, you can add managed permission sets to your local group
- Muting is possible in a permission set group, but the access to the permission should be granted through that permission set group.

## Users in Salesforce

- Every user must have a Salesforce license and a profile.
- Users cannot be deleted, but can be **Activated**, **Deactivated**, or **Frozen**.

### Frozen User

- Freezing a user suspends their login access without deactivating their license.
- If you intend to prevent a user from accessing Salesforce, you can proceed with freezing their account. Alternatively, if the user is no longer using the Salesforce instance, you can deactivate their account.

:::info
**In certain scenarios, users may encounter difficulties in immediately deactivating their accounts, In such Scenarios freezing is useful.**

**Scenarios**

- User is default owner of leads.
- User is default or automated case owner.
- User is default lead creator or owner.
- User is default workflow user.
- User is recipient of a workflow email alert.
- A user selected in a custom hierarchy field.
- User is a customer portal administrator.

  :::

  :::warning
  It is worth considering the potential impact of deactivation. Deactivating a user frees up the associated license, which can be utilized by another user. Conversely, freezing a user will not release the licenses that are currently in use.
  :::

### Deactivated User

- Deactivating a user in Salesforce means that user will not be deleted from the system.
- They cannot be part of workflows or any part of automated process.
- Deactivating a user will make the #licenses available for use within your organization.
- Deactivated users lose access to any records that were manually shared with them, or records that were shared with them as team members.
- Users higher in the role hierarchy relative to the deactivated users also lose access to those records. However, you can still transfer their data to other users and view their names on the Users page.
- User will no longer be able to log in to Salesforce and their records can be transferred to another user.
- Whenever you are transferring a record to another user. that new user should have Salesforce Licenses assigned to him.
