- **Salesforce** is a _Platform as a Service (PaaS)_ and _Software as a Service (SaaS)_ provider.
- **Salesforce is not** an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider.
- **Force.com** is a PaaS offered by Salesforce for building platform applications.
- Salesforce uses a **multitenant architecture**: multiple tenants share a single instance of the application, environment, hardware, or storage.
- Salesforce generates **18-digit case-insensitive External IDs** and **15-digit case-sensitive Record IDs**.
- Convert 15-digit case-sensitive record IDs to 18-digit case-insensitive IDs using the `CASESAFEID()` formula function.

:::tip
Use `CASESAFEID()` to safely reference record IDs in integrations and formulas.

## User Licenses

- Every user must be assigned a **user license** to access Salesforce. The license determines the features available to the user.

### Types of User Licenses

- **Login-Based User Licenses**
  - _Lightning Platform Starter_
  - _Lightning Platform Plus_
  - _Salesforce Platform Login_
- **Based on Job Function**
  - _Lightning Platform user license_: Standard object permissions for accounts and contacts (not cases).
  - _Salesforce user license_: Full access to standard CRM apps and objects (accounts, contacts, cases).

:::info
Salesforce packages licenses in SKUs (stock-keeping units). SKUs may contain one or more licenses and capabilities.
:::

## Queue in Salesforce

- A **queue** is a group of users sharing workload.
- Records assigned to a queue must be accepted by a user to become the record’s owner.
- Ownership can be transferred to another queue user or any other user.

:::tip
When transferring a record, ensure the new user has a Salesforce license assigned.
:::

## Permission Set

- Up to **1000 permission sets** can be created per org.
- Used to enhance access levels.
- To assign a permission set, the user must have a Salesforce license.

### Permission Set Group

- Bundle permission sets together based on job function.
- Includes all permissions from the grouped sets.
- **Muting** is possible to restrict specific permissions within a group.

## Users in Salesforce

- Every user must have a Salesforce license and a profile.
- Users cannot be deleted, but can be **Activated**, **Deactivated**, or **Frozen**.

### Frozen User

:::info
Freezing a user suspends their login access without deactivating their license.
:::

**Scenarios where freezing is useful:**

- User is default owner of leads/cases.
- User is a workflow user or recipient.
- User is a customer portal admin.
- User is selected in a custom hierarchy field.

:::warning
Freezing does **not** release the license. Deactivating a user does.
:::

### Deactivated User

- Deactivated users cannot log in or participate in workflows.
- Their licenses become available for reassignment.
- Manually shared records and team access are lost.
- Data can be transferred to other users.

## Organization-Wide Default (OWD)

- Sets baseline access to data not owned by the user.
- Can be set for custom and some standard objects.

### Access Levels

- **Public Read/Write**: All users can see and edit every record.
- **Public Read-Only**: All users can see every record.
- **Private**: Users can only see records they own.
- **Public Read/Write/Transfer**: Only for Lead and Case objects.

:::tip
Enable "Manual User Record Sharing" to allow users to share their records.
:::

## Sharing Model

- Sharing rules can be set for every standard and custom object.
- Used to create exceptions to OWD for specific users.

### Types of Sharing Mechanisms

- **Manual Sharing**
- **Apex Sharing**
- **Public Groups**
- **Sharing Rules**
  - Criteria-based
  - Owner-based

:::info
Sharing rules can only grant wider access, not restrict it.
:::

## Reports in Salesforce

Salesforce supports four types of reports:

1. **Tabular**: Data in rows and columns.
2. **Summary**: Group by rows.
3. **Matrix**: Group by columns.
4. **Joined**: Combine multiple report types.

## Key Points Regarding Objects

- New custom objects have four standard fields:
  - Name
  - Owner
  - Created By
  - Last Modified By

:::warning
These fields cannot be deleted.
:::

## Relationship Types

- Relationships are created on the child object.
- Two main types:
  - **One-to-Many**
  - **Many-to-Many** (using Junction objects)
- Four categories:
  - Lookup
  - Master-Detail
  - Self
  - Hierarchical

### Lookup Relationship

- **Definition:** Connects two objects (child-parent).
- **Purpose:** Retrieve values from related objects.
- **Implementation:** Add lookup fields and related lists to page layouts.

**Characteristics:**

- Loosely coupled (deleting parent does not delete child).
- Field references can be null.
- No cascade deletion.
- Sharing/security are independent.
- Max 40 relationships per child object (38 lookup + 2 master-detail).

### Master-Detail Relationship

- Strong parent-child connection.
- Child inherits parent security; deleting parent deletes children.
- Supports **roll-up summary fields**.
- Owner field on child is set to parent owner.
- No sharing rules/manual sharing/queues on detail side.

:::tip
Enable "Allow Reparenting" to move child records to different parents.
:::

## Field Dependencies

- Dynamically filter picklist values based on another field (controlling field).
- Controlling field: Standard/custom checkbox or picklist (1–300 values).
- Dependent field: Custom picklist or multi-select picklist.

## Field History Tracking

- Enable during object creation.
- Track changes to selected fields (old/new values, date, user).
- Multi-select picklists and large text fields are tracked as edited only.

## Rollup-Summary Field

- Up to **10 roll-up summary fields** per object.
- Available on master object in master-detail relationships.
- Aggregate operations: Sum, Min, Max, Count.
- Can include all or filtered child records.

:::info
Some standard relationships (e.g., Account-Opportunity) behave as master-detail for roll-up summaries.
:::

## Button Links and Actions

- **Global Action:** Available on home/chatter/object pages (cannot create related records).
- **Object-Specific Action:** Related to objects, can create related records.

## Recycle Bin in Salesforce

- Records remain for **15 days** in the Recycle Bin.
- Can be restored within this period; after 15 days, records are permanently deleted.
