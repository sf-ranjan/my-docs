These structures are good when projects are mostly contained within one functional area. One of the important things to remember is that if you are a project analyst or coordinator in a functional organization structure, you will have little to no authority in making project decisions or managing the project budget and resources. The resources, budget, and authority are controlled by the functional managers.
