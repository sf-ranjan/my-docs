Sounds simple right? Objectives typically represent themselves in terms of cost, time, and scope (also known as the Triple Constraint). As long as we know the objectives, we should be able to meet them, right? It may come as a surprise to you, but often times projects fail to meet their objectives. It isn\'t so simple because the number of factors that must be controlled can, and often do, interact in unexpected ways. Consequently, the project becomes more complicated as the number of factors increases.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/management-basics/project-management-office":{"id":"guide/management-basics/project-management-office","title":"Project Management Office","description":"Many companies use a specialized organizational structure to support Project Managers and projects within the company. This structure is called a Project Management Office (PMO) or Project Office (PO). The PMO structure has been implemented in many companies in an effort to improve the overall success rate of projects. Their primary purpose is to provide support to the projects and Project Managers within an organization.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/management-basics/project-selection":{"id":"guide/management-basics/project-selection","title":"Project Selection","description":"Projects can be initiated from many sources within an organization. Typically, an organization has more projects than they have resources to deliver them. So, they have a choice: to either try to get all the projects done with minimal resources and lengthen the time to achieve the benefits for every project, or they can narrow down the list of projects to those that will reap the greatest benefit to the clients, the business, and the employees. If the project list is narrowed, it allows an organization to properly staff for effective delivery. Project selection is the process used by companies to decide the best projects to implement. We will also be discussing the various types of organizations a project manager may operate within and the advantages and disadvantages that each structure brings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/management-basics/project-structure":{"id":"guide/management-basics/project-structure","title":"Project Structure","description":"Project Structures Within Organizations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/management-basics/project-team":{"id":"guide/management-basics/project-team","title":"Project Team","description":"One of the Project Manager\'s responsibilities is to ensure they have the proper team with the proper skills to execute the project.

This means ensuring they have the right team assembled to complete the work.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Tutorial Intro","description":"Let\'s discover Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes."}}}}')}}]);
