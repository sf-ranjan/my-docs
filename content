# Project Management Office<a name = "Project-Management-Office"></a>

Many companies use a specialized organizational structure to support Project Managers and projects within the company. This structure is called a Project Management Office (PMO) or Project Office (PO). The PMO structure has been implemented in many companies in an effort to improve the overall success rate of projects. Their primary purpose is to provide support to the projects and Project Managers within an organization.

A PMO can provide a wide variety of support options to projects including:

- Own and provide support for the organization's Project Management methods and processes.
- Provide Project Management expertise and coaching.
- Provide Project Management education for the organization.
- Provide project auditing.
- Support the organization's project tools and techniques.
- Serve as a repository for best practices.
- Provide standards for reporting and measuring project progress.
- Facilitate project reviews with Senior Management.
- Assist with resource allocations across projects.
- Assist with project selection and support the Project Portfolio management process.

When organizations establish a PMO they often times are striving to standardize the Project Management practice, methodology, and tools across the entire company. PMOs have become quite popular as projects have become more and more complex to deliver in our global economy. However, the success rate of PMOs is quite varied.

The ultimate goal of a PMO is to provide value to the organization, the projects, and the Project Managers. And although Project Management has accepted methods based on the standards from such organizations as the Project Management Institute, there are no industry standard structures, functions, or goals of a PMO. Organizations that utilize PMOs design them specifically for the functions and projects within that organization. As you might expect, because of this variation, some PMOs are much more effective than others. The closer the alignment of PMO objectives to the strategy and goals of the organization, the more likely the PMO can be successful.

> **_NOTE:_** So far we have reviewed the project selection process and the various organization structures that projects can operate in.Once an organization selects their portfolio of projects, they must initiate the projects.
> Now we will explore how to initiate a project in detail. The first phase in the project lifecycle is initiation. In this phase, the project manager learns the objectives of the project, the business reasons for which it was selected, information about project deliverables, timeline, and budget,and gains approval to proceed with the project. **_We will also explore a key initiation deliverable called the Project Charter_**.The initiation phase is an important phase to the project because it lays the foundation for the reasons the project is undertaken and the primary business benefits and goals the project is expected to achieve. The initiation phase solidifies these elements and ensures all stakeholders are in agreement about the reasons and objectives for the project. It also serves as an acknowledgement by management of the resources required to deliver the project, including the budget, the schedule, and the scope.
